# Bonding support in netcfg
#
# The basic syntax is the same as with a norma Ethernet connection,
# except that you have to specify the slaves interfaces in the SLAVES
# variable.
#
# You have to load the "bonding" module first; please refer to the Wiki
# for more details
# http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Configuring_network#bonding
#
# If you want to combine an Ethernet interface with a Wireless one (to be
# able to disconnect your cable and be mobile without losing your
# connection), you should consider *not* adding your wireless interface
# to the SLAVES variable. Instead, assuming your bonding interface is bond0
# and your wireless interface is wlan0, add the following lines in your
# wireless profile:
#   IP="static"
#   IFOPTS="0.0.0.0"
#   PRE_UP="ifenslave bond0 wlan0"
#   PRE_DOWN="ifenslave -d bond0 wlan0"
# That way, netcfg will manage the wireless connection properly (with WEP,
# WPA, and all their funny stuff) and the bonding profile will only do
# what it is supposed to do.
